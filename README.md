# qcurl
found phpinfo.php want to test in a list of domains ? 


# How it works 
for example if you found a `error_dev_back.log` in a domain and you want to test it the devs make the same mistake in a list of domains 
it will send a curl request and will see who got `200` status code 


# install 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/iKamash/qcurl.git
$ cd qcurl
$ chmod +x qcurl.sh
$ sudo mv qcurl /usr/local/bin/qcurl
```
